Sudoku Solver

A simple C++ program that solves a Sudoku board using recursion. 

To use, the user must enter the Sudoku puzzle into the Sudoku.txt file
as plaintext, with the empty squares replaced with 0's.

An example of what Sudoku.txt should look like:

900002008
150000000
000005940
203050010
006001095
000090000
300900700
007068000
020000600

The program ignores white space, so all that matters is that there are 81 numbers.

Once the puzzle is in the Sudoku.txt file, then run the SudokuSolver.exe and a 
console will display both the unsolved and the solved board.
